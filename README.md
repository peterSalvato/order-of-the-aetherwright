# The Order of the Ætherwright  
*A symbolic system under construction.*

This repository contains the foundational structure, symbolic architecture, and early framework of the Ætherwright System—a modular, intentional interface for working with identity, thought, and ritual.

The tools described here—overlays, artifacts, glyph systems, and ritual workflows—are not yet complete, released, or available for use.

> **This is not a product. It is a scaffold.**  
> A public record of intellectual authorship, and a trace of a system in construction.

## What This Is

The Order of the Ætherwright is a symbolic operating system for sovereign cognition.

This repository serves as a **living architectural draft**, documenting:
- The core symbolic philosophy of the Order
- Planned structure for theming tools and digital interfaces
- Ritual metaphors for workspace immersion
- Visual glyph systems, command logic, and printable artifacts

What you see here is a **formal declaration of direction**, not a toolkit.

## Intellectual Property Notice

All materials, concepts, language, and structural designs within this repository are original works by **Peter Salvato**.

This includes:
- Glyphs and symbolic systems
- Structural metaphors (e.g., Bench, Chamber, Codex, Relay)
- Terminology, command aliases, and system logic
- Design of overlays, printables, and 3D artifacts (even if not fully implemented)

> **These are protected works**, in development but not in the public domain.  
> See `LICENSE.md` and `ip_declaration.md` for specifics.

This repository is timestamped, versioned, and archived to assert authorship, origin, and intent.

## Current Status

This system is in active development.  
Nothing here is ready for public use or installation.

Folders and files reflect planned components only:
- Overlays and theme files are **incomplete**
- Install scripts are **proposed but not functional**
- Artifacts and templates are **under construction**
- Language and doctrine files are **in drafting**

---

## Why This Is Public

This repository exists to:
- **Protect the system’s originality** through public timestamping
- **Document the evolution** of the Order’s structural architecture
- **Mark authorship** at the level of concept and expression

It is not here for public contribution or implementation at this time.

### Future Path

This system is under active development.  
The next phases will include:

- Themed overlays for Bench, Chamber, Codex, and Relay  
- A complete Drop Kit with install instructions and printables  
- Shell alias framework and symbolic command usage  
- Public walkthrough of glyphs and their usage  
- Optional pedagogical layers and journaling rituals

All development is intentional and sovereignly paced.  
You are welcome to observe, wait, or prepare your tools.
