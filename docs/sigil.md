# The Ætherwright Sigil

---

## I. Purpose of the Sigil

The Ætherwright Sigil is a symbolic lockup that represents the complete system in visual form. It serves as a ceremonial seal, used for marking artifacts, tools, documents, and identities aligned with the Order.

It is not Codex syntax. It is not used for classification. It is used to visually affirm philosophical alignment, authorship, or presence.

---

## II. Core Construction

The sigil consists of:

- **8 fixed glyphs** arranged in a radial wheel
- **Central dot (●)** representing Self / Ritual / Core
- **Chevrons ‹›** may be placed around the wheel to suggest phase emphasis

All elements are drawn from the closed symbolic system.

---

## III. Positional Logic

Each glyph occupies a directional position. These are not arbitrary—they reflect symbolic relationships:

| Position      | Glyph | Domain                  | Meaning                             |
|---------------|-------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Top (12:00)   | ▲     | Systems / Strategy       | Structure, mapping                  |
| Bottom (6:00) | ▼     | Narrative                | Symbolic flow, sequence             |
| Left (9:00)   | ◀     | Intuition / Process      | Internal rhythm, reflection         |
| Right (3:00)  | ▶     | Illustration / Output    | Expression, execution               |
| Top Left      | ◆     | Craft / Physical Work    | Making, fabrication                 |
| Top Right     | ■     | Design / Grid            | Spatial logic, typographic order    |
| Bottom Left   | ⬟     | Photography / Observation| Framing, stillness, witness         |
| Bottom Right  | ⬠     | Code / Engineering       | Architecture, logical systems       |

**Center**: `●` represents ritual presence and embodied intention.

## IV. Tier Modifiers

The sigil can include symbolic modifiers that indicate a practitioner's current tier of engagement. These are optional and always placed *outside* the core sigil:

| Symbol        | Tier                 | Placement / Style                       |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `/`           | Initiate             | Small stroke beneath or beside the sigil|
| `//`          | Threshold / Seeker   | Double stroke beneath                   |
| `æ`           | Ætherwright          | Integrated at edge or near center        |
| `æ + ★ + ●` | Steward Architect      | Complete sigil lock (glyph + mark + seal)|

These modifiers are visual only. They are not part of syntax or metadata.

---

## V. Usage Contexts

The sigil is used in symbolic or ceremonial contexts:

- Cover of field guides, zines, and manuals
- Ring stamps, wax seals, or digital overlays
- Header marks in sacred documents
- Personal artifacts or tools of aligned practitioners

It is never required. It is always deliberate.

---

## VI. Sigil vs. Codex

The sigil does not replace the Codex. It serves a different function.

| Purpose                  | Codex Syntax | Sigil Symbol |
|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Tracking creative phases | ✅            | ❌            |
| Classifying domain use   | ✅            | ❌            |
| Ritual / alignment mark  | ❌            | ✅            |
| Public identity lockup   | ❌            | ✅            |
| Metadata or naming use   | ✅            | ❌            |
| Visual emblem            | ❌            | ✅            |

The sigil is not decorative. It is not branding.
It is a **signal**: this system is authored, intentional, and lived.
