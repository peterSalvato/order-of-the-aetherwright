# Usage Guide: Living Within the Order

This document outlines how a practitioner may eventually use the Order of the Ætherwright system. It is not instructional—it is inspirational.

---

## Your Bench

The Order begins with your tools:

- **VSCode** – Your Bench: where structure is built
- **Terminal** – Your Chamber: where commands invoke symbolic logic
- **Obsidian** – Your Codex: where reflections and artifacts are kept
- **Firefox** – Your Relay: where dialogue, research, and AI communion occur

These tools are themed and arranged to feel immersive.  
They form your symbolic workstation—the interface between the internal and the external.

## Your Shell

You invoke the system via symbolic commands:

- `aetherize` → enter the environment  
- `fieldlog` → record observations or reflections  
- `invoke` → run a symbolic action  
- `sigil` → preview or print a glyph  
- `benchplate` → initialize a new project space

These aliases create a language of Work.  
They do not replace command line—they ritualize it.

## Your Practice

You use printables, 3D stamps, or visual overlays to:

- Label notebooks, files, folders, environments
- Stamp glyphs into sketchbooks or physical archives
- Trigger specific states of Work (via symbolic workspace setup)

Every object has intent. Every command has resonance.

## Your Path

This is a sovereign system.  
You are not bound by steps—you assemble your own ritual stack.

- Use all four stations (Bench, Chamber, Codex, Relay)—or only two  
- Ignore overlays and use the glyph system for analog practice  
- Integrate slowly, as the tools emerge  
- Or simply observe, reflect, and study

The Order is an interface, not an imposition.
